# Compare AgentJet with Other Platforms with Agentic RL


- Multi OSS Training Backbone: Support switching between multiple open-source training backbones quickly.
- Multi OSS Infer Backbone: Support both vLLM and SGLang.
- Low Code Change: Do not require too many edits to convert a user‑defined (multi) agent workflow into trainable workflows.
- Without-GPU (Cloud-Computing): Rollout and power RL training in a laptop without GPU, using Tinker (AgentLightning) or without Tinker (AgentJet-TinkerScript, comming soon)
- Timeline Optimization: Automatically merge shared-history context generated by the same agents to promote training speed.
- Open Bench Platform: Trace baseline environment's performance across git history in different training backbones.
- Multi-Agent Optimization: Deal with sophisticated multi-agent interaction efficiently, automatically clustering and merging samples generated by the same agents.
- High-res Rollout Logging: Integrated with token level rollout trajectory, highlighting token logprob and loss mask for deep‑level research.
- Agentic Framework Compatible: Easy to convert AgentScope and Langchain workflows into trainable workflows.
